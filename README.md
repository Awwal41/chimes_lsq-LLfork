Contributing

Contributions to the ChIMES generator should be made through a pull request, with ``develop`` as the destination branch. A test suite log file should be attached to the PR. For additional contributing guidelines, see the documentation.

Releases
--------

For most users, we recommend using the ChIMES calculator stable releases.

Update this link ------> [stable releases](https://github.com/rk-lindsey/chimes_calculator/releases).

Each ChIMES generator release series also has a corresponding branch, e.g. `releases/v0.14` has `0.14.x` versions, and `releases/v0.13` has `0.13.x` versions. We back-port important bug fixes to these branches but we do not advance the package versions or make changes that would otherwise change the way ChIMES generator is used or behaves. So, you can base your ChIMES deployment on a release branch and `git pull` to get fixes, without the continuous changes that comes with `develop`.  The latest release is always available with the `releases/latest` tag.
