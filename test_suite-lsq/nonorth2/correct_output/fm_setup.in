# WRAPTRJ # ! Does the trajectory file need wrapping? (i.e. post-run PBC)
	true
# NFRAMES # ! How many frames are in the .xyzf file?
	10
# NLAYERS # ! x,y, and z supercells.. small unit cell should have >= 1
	1
# FITCOUL # ! Fit charges? If false, use user-specified fixed charges, and subtract them from the forces -- NOTE: FUNCTIONALITY CURRENTLY ONLY SUPPORTED FOR TRUE, AND FALSE WITH CHARGES = 0
	false
