Notes on new features:

NXXBINS: If no 3body interactions are being fit, set all to zero. Used to create histograms of observed 3-body distances. If no distances are observed within a 
         specific bin, the potential energy for that bin is set to zero for force matching. For a given pair type, NXXBINS is the number
	 of bins to use when the pair occurs as XX in the 3body interaction. ...There are still some kinks to work out/ testing to be done
	 here, so for now, use the same number of bins for all XX of a given pair type
	 
FCUTTYP: Specifies the functional form of the 3b smoothing function. Optional. If not set, defaults to our cubic fcut function. For a
         sigmoid type, the two arguments are the sigmoid steepmenss and offset respectively. ONLY used when 3-body terms are being fit.
	 


####### CONTROL VARIABLES #######

# TRJFILE # ! The .xyzf file containing the trajectory. Like a typical xyz, but comment line has box dimes, and each line includes x,y, and z force
	co_38gpa_100_forces_subtracted.xyzf
# WRAPTRJ # ! Does the trajectory file need wrapping? (i.e. post-run PBC)
	true
# NFRAMES # ! How many frames are in the .xyzf file?
	100
# NLAYERS # ! x,y, and z supercells.. small unit cell should have >= 1
	1
# FITCOUL # ! Fit charges? If false, use user-specified fixed charges, and subtract them from the forces -- NOTE: FUNCTIONALITY CURRENTLY ONLY SUPPORTED FOR TRUE, AND FALSE WITH CHARGES = 0
	false
# CNSCOUL # ! Will we try to have consistent charges -- only used when FITCOUL is true?
	false	
# FITSTRS # ! Fit stress tensors?
	false
# FITENER # ! Fit stress tensors?
	false	
# FITPOVR # ! Use ReaxFF linear overcoordination parameters? If this is false and parameters are provided below, those parameters will be subtracted from forces
	false
# PAIRTYP # ! Short-range interaction type. See manual for accepted types. Case sensitive #.. 3b order 5 eventually
	CHEBYSHEV 0 5 -1 0
# CHBTYPE # ! Are we transforming distance in terms of inverse distance(INVRSE_R), a morse-type function? (MORSE)? .. "DEFAULT" for no transformation.
	MORSE
