This is a program that automatically tests ReaxFF force fields against
QCISDT quantum simulations for diatomics.  Please read the diatomic.pl
program for comments.  Diatomic.pl must be run from an interactive
terminal capable of launching parallel jobs, such as an mxterm, or
from within an LC batch submission script.
