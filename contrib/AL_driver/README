Tool now works for ALC iterations for a single system, at a single state point.
Next tasks include adding a resubmission capability for MD, adding an overall
restart capability, and enabling parallel learning.

This tool has only been added to the SVN repo for tracking - it is not yet ready
for general use. Currently, capabilities only include learning at a single state
point, using lars/lasso as the LSQ solver.
