Parallel learning seems to be working, after initial tests. Next few commits will focus on:
	+ a CFG_REPO clean up capability (to minimize files)
	+ distributed solving (DLARS) ... requires a-mat chunks

04/29/19 - RKL:
Restart handling has been fully tested, for single-system ALC iterations. Next few commits will focus on adding support for parallel learning.

04/25/19 - RKL:
Basic restart handling has been added, for single-system ALC iterations. This functionality has only been tested on a superficial level so far. Next commit will be for "stable" restart functioanlity.

04/19/19 - RKL:
Tool now works for ALC iterations for a single system, at a single state point.
Next tasks include adding a resubmission capability for MD, adding an overall
restart capability, and enabling parallel learning.  

04/15/19 - RKL:
This tool has only been added to the SVN repo for tracking - it is not yet ready
for general use. Currently, capabilities only include learning at a single state
point, using lars/lasso as the LSQ solver.


First stable commit: Tool now works for ALC iterations for a single system,
at a single state point.

Next tasks include: 
	+ Adding a resubmission capability for MD
	+ Adding an overall restart capability
	+ Enabling parallel learning
