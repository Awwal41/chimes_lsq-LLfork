Using built-in settings
Block averaging of 10 steps
Molecules with more than 24 atoms are treated as a polymer
Stop reading after frame 100000 (or end of file)
Molecules with mass fractions less than 0.000100 will not be printed out
The minimum molecular lifetime is 0.048000 picoseconds
The number of iterations to use in finding a reaction is 10
Reaction rates will be analyzed
13 frames were read in
